# VCK5000 simple sum example

This is a simple sum example to demonstrate the building, emulation, and execution of an AIE kernel on the Versal. It takes a list of input values, adds a value to each of these, and sends the results back. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the appropriate commands for the FPGA testbed and it can also act as a template for more complex kernels. It includes the AIE code itself, PL kernels to undertake data movement, and host driver code.

Full details about how to build and emulate this are available on the testbed website [here](https://fpga.epcc.ed.ac.uk/docs/vck5000_building_emulation.html).
